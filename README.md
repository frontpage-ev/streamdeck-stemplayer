# Stem Player for Stream Deck

"Stem Player for Stream Deck" is a specially designed software aimed at controlling music stems (individual parts of a
music track such as bass, drums, vocals, etc.) via the popular Stream Deck interface. This integration allows users to
control, mix and manipulate elements of a song in real time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This software is just the Stem Player for Stream Deck. You need
> the [Stream Deck Plugin](https://github.com/frontpage-ev/streamdeck-stemplayer-plugin) too to use it.
